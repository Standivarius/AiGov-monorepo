# AiGov Monorepo

Start here: read `/AGENTS.md`.

## Daily workflow (Codex)
- Start session: `$new-chat`
- Make smallest PR
- End session: `$end-chat`

## Claude Code (optional)
Use Claude Code for large mechanical edits/refactors; bring results back to Codex for gating + verification.
See `/AGENTS.md`.

## Monorepo-only policy
AiGov-monorepo is canonical. Legacy repos are deprecated; do not clone them for runs/builds.
See docs/migration/LEGACY_REPOS.md (placeholder; landing next PR).
