# Module Registry Contracts

Canonical module naming for AiGov product spine lives in:

- `module_registry_v0.yaml`

Usage rules:

- Use `id` values (`M_*`) in planning, requirements, and PR scopes.
- Use `canonical_name` only as human-friendly label.
- Treat `legacy_ids` as migration aliases only.
