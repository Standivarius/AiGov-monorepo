# Intake Contracts

This folder defines intake outputs used by Pre2.3 and Pre2.4 contracts.

## Links
- Reporting crosswalk: `packages/specs/docs/contracts/reporting/report_fields_crosswalk_v0_1.md`
- Scenario expansion: `packages/specs/docs/contracts/scenarios/scenario_instance_expansion_rules_v0_1.md`
- Bespoke scenario spec: `packages/specs/docs/contracts/scenarios/bespoke_scenario_spec_v0_1.md`

## Notes
- Intake outputs are schema-first and feed scenario instance generation.
- Mock target profile must stay aligned with target_profile to avoid drift.
