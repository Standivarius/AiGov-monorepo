You are Claude Code running an adversarial test review for AiGov monorepo milestone:
M_Execution: Deterministic Bundle Consumption (GDPR-only).

Target stack: #164 -> #165 -> #166 -> #167.

Primary objective:
Break fail-closed/deterministic assumptions and report gaps.

Adversarial probes to attempt:
- unknown keys vs additionalProperties:false
- bad schema_version
- missing required scenario fields
- malformed sha256
- path traversal / absolute paths
- dual-manifest ambiguity fixture behavior
- gate robustness of expected-fail substring assertions

Rules:
- You may create temporary local files for experiments, but do NOT commit temp artifacts.
- Keep findings mapped to earliest affected PR.

Run commands:
1) python3 tools/validate_planning_pack.py
2) bash tools/run_pr_gate_validators.sh
3) NX_DAEMON=false npx nx run evalsets:migration-smoke

Output format (strict):
1) MUST FIX
2) SHOULD FIX
3) COULD
4) Merge readiness per PR (#164/#165/#166/#167) with ✅ or ⚠️
5) Top 3 adversarial/determinism risks
6) Command results (PASS/FAIL)
7) Suggested additional fixtures (only if they improve deterministic gate coverage)
