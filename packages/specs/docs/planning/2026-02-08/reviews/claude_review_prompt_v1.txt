You are Claude Code in the AiGov devcontainer. This is a SECOND independent review in a Gemini-style mode (broad + adversarial), not implementation.

Read first:
- packages/specs/docs/planning/2026-02-08/reviews/claude_review_pack_v1.md
- packages/specs/docs/planning/2026-02-08/reviews/claude_review_evidence_v1.md

Review PR stack in strict order:
- #150 -> #151 -> #152 -> #153 -> #154

Focus areas:
- fail-closed determinism
- regression safety of canonical intake bundle validation
- fixture gating correctness (stage fixtures validated by correct stage mode)
- schema strictness vs future-proofing tradeoffs
- contract/documentation consistency with validator behavior

Run exactly:
- python3 tools/validate_planning_pack.py
- bash tools/run_pr_gate_validators.sh
- NX_DAEMON=false npx nx run evalsets:migration-smoke

Output format (required):
1) MUST findings
2) SHOULD findings
3) COULD findings
4) Merge readiness per PR (#150-#154): ✅ or ⚠️ + one-line reason
5) Top 3 audit/determinism risks
6) Command results (pass/fail)

Do not implement fixes. Review only.
