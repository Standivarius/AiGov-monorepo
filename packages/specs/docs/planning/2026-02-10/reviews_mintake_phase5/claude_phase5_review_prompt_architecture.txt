You are doing an independent architecture/system-boundary review for AiGov Monorepo Phase 5.

Scope:
- Review PR stack in order: #182, #183, #184, #185.
- Use review context file: packages/specs/docs/planning/2026-02-10/reviews_mintake_phase5/claude_phase5_review_pack.md

Hard reviewer constraints:
- READ-ONLY review mode. Do NOT modify files. Do NOT commit. Do NOT open PRs.
- Claude suggests fixes only. Codex is the only agent that implements changes.
- Focus on fail-closed behavior, deterministic outputs, regression safety, schema/contract alignment, and gate correctness.

Checks to emphasize:
- contract-first boundaries and schema-vs-policy separation
- no scope drift (no live connector/auth, no EP runtime integration)
- deterministic ordering and byte-stable serialization
- strict handling of github_export_pack layout and malformed inputs
- planning-pack pass/fail wiring correctness and stable substring assertions

Run required commands:
- python3 tools/validate_planning_pack.py
- bash tools/run_pr_gate_validators.sh
- NX_DAEMON=false npx nx run evalsets:migration-smoke

Return format (strict):
1) MUST FIX
2) SHOULD FIX
3) COULD
4) Merge readiness per PR (#182-#185)
5) Top 3 architectural/determinism risks
6) Proof command summary
7) Codex handoff (minimal file-scoped fix slices)
