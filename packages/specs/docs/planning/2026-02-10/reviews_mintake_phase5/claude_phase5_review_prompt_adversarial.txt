You are doing an independent adversarial review for AiGov Monorepo Phase 5.

Scope:
- Review PR stack in order: #182, #183, #184, #185.
- Use review context file: packages/specs/docs/planning/2026-02-10/reviews_mintake_phase5/claude_phase5_review_pack.md

Hard reviewer constraints:
- READ-ONLY review mode. Do NOT modify tracked files. Do NOT commit. Do NOT open PRs.
- Temporary local scratch files for probes are allowed but must not be committed.
- Claude suggests fixes only. Codex is the only agent that implements changes.

Adversarial probes to run (at minimum):
- unknown keys (root and nested) against snapshot/extract artifacts
- wrong `schema_version`
- missing required fields
- malformed/uppercase/short sha256
- bad path inputs: absolute, traversal
- github_export_pack shape violations
- unsupported extension in recognized github_export_pack path
- deterministic multi-error ordering across repeated runs
- byte-equality across repeated adapter runs

Run required commands:
- python3 tools/validate_planning_pack.py
- bash tools/run_pr_gate_validators.sh
- NX_DAEMON=false npx nx run evalsets:migration-smoke

Return format (strict):
1) MUST FIX
2) SHOULD FIX
3) COULD
4) Merge readiness per PR (#182-#185)
5) Top 3 adversarial/determinism risks
6) Proof command summary
7) Adversarial probe matrix (probe / expected / actual)
8) Codex handoff (minimal file-scoped fix slices)
