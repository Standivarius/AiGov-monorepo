# Method Execution Plan v1

Date: `2026-02-20`  
Objective: run method-first setup to completion before PRD drafting or implementation.

## Phase A — Method lock

Deliverables:
- `METHOD_SELECTION_MEMO_v1.md`
- `AIGOV_FACTORY_METHOD_v1.md`

Exit criteria:
- method option explicitly selected,
- stage gates accepted.

## Phase B — Pre-PRD Discovery completion

Deliverables:
- `PRE_PRD_DISCOVERY_PACK_v0.md`
- `PRE_PRD_CHECKLIST_v0.md`
- Example map files from template
- first Scenario Pack instance aligned to spec

Exit criteria:
- Pre-PRD checklist passes,
- unresolved blocker questions = 0 for walking skeleton,
- approval recorded.

## Phase C — PRD compilation and authorization gate (still no coding)

Action:
- produce and approve `PRD-P`, `PRD-M`, and `PRD-E` baseline.

Exit criteria:
- explicit gate record that Pre-PRD is complete.
- explicit gate record that `PRD-P`, `PRD-M`, and `PRD-E` are approved.

## Phase D — Build readiness decision (still no coding in this plan)

Action:
- evaluate whether implementation can start, but do not start it in this plan.

Exit criteria:
- approved build-readiness record with first slice and proof commands.

## Out of scope for this plan

- Any implementation milestone kickoff
- Any architecture refactor in code
- Any new runtime features
