## PR-A: Codex operating scaffolding
- Added repo-scoped Codex skills under `.codex/skills` (new-chat, end-chat, codex-rules).
- Established STATUS discipline: record what changed, why, and what's next.
- Ignored local smoke logs and workspace artifacts (EVALSET-MIGRATION-SMOKE-v1_*.log, node_modules/, .nx/, packages/**/.venv).
- Next: PR-0/PR-B to land monorepo structure + cross-platform smoke runners.
