# Assurance docs (AiGov-specs)

These are **version-controlled templates and requirements**.
Filled-in artefacts and third-party reports belong in SharePoint/OneDrive under `AIGov/01_Assurance-Vault/`.

Key files:
- `assurance-index.md`: pointer doc structure (how claims map to evidence).
- `software-requirements.md`: requirement IDs used by ADRs and architecture docs.
- `business-readiness.md`: business-level readiness items and document/evidence triggers.
- `claims-language.md`: approved “aligned with” vs “certified” language.
