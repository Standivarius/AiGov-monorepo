# Claims & limitations language (v0.x)

## Allowed claims (examples)
- "Produces replayable evaluation evidence bundles with immutable manifests and artefact hashes."
- "Designed for data minimisation by default; raw transcript retention is optional and client-controlled."

## Avoid (unless formally certified / legally validated)
- "GDPR compliant"
- "ISO 27001 certified" (unless your business has the certificate and scope statement)
- "EU AI Act compliant" (avoid broad claims; be specific about controls/evidence)

## Required limitations (always include)
- "This evaluation pack is not a certification and does not replace legal advice."
- "Findings are bounded by scenario coverage and the configured target environment."
- "Non-deterministic target systems may produce variance; judgement is performed offline under fixed parameters."
